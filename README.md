I have analyzed NBA basketball dataset. This analysis is based on the multivariate normal prior. The data has been collected in the form of 28 variables from 30 teams. In this project, I found Bayesian estimates using the GLM model. The diverse section of the aforementioned project include the following:
1.	Data retrieval in R software.
2.	Data cleanup.
3.	Fitting the complete logistic regression model to the data.
4.	Removing meaningless coefficients using stepwise regression.
5.	Comparison of full and reduced model.
6.	Fitting the Bayesian logistic regression model to the data.
7.	Comparison of actual and predicted success probability values.
